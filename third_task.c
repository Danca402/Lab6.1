/* Task description:
Please visit the homepage for visual information!!!
Let us define a Point type to store two-dimensional coordinates (x, y)! Write the following functions operating on this data type:

    dist(): calculates the distance between the two points received (using the Pythagorean theorem)
    equal(): checks if to points are equal or not
    read(): reads a point from the keyboard and returns it 

  In the main, define two points, and test all these functions. When all tests are passed, solve the following task by utilizing the structure and functions defined above:

  A farmer wants to surround his land with a wire fence. Write a program to compute how much fence is required! 
  The program asks the farmer to enter the coordinates of the corner points of the fence, calculates the distances, and sums them up. Repeat these steps as long as the new coordinates are not equal to the first one (hence, till we return to the starting point).

  It is recommended to store the starting point in a separate variable. 
  After that, two more point variables are needed to calculate the length of a fence segment: one of them stores the current point, and the other the previous one.
